<H1 align="center">	Strategies for offline and online learning what should be done</h1>
<br>
<br>
The following elements should be part of a successful strategy integrating online<br> and offline 
teaching and learning activities:

<br>
<ul type="square">
<li> Internet   </li>
<p>Guarantee access to internet and availability of computers, laptops, or tablets:<br> 
access to the internet at a decent speed and to proper ICT tools are basic <br>
prerequisites for any online teaching and learning strategy. </p>
<br>


<br>
<li>Environment</li>
<p>Adopt proper Virtual Learning Environments (VLE): VLE can give learners access <br>
to educational resources, connect students with teachers and facilitate remote <br>
lessons.  </p>
<br>


<br>
<li>Broadcasting</li>
<p>Rethink the role of broadcasting education: educational broadcasting can be a <br>
useful complement to online programmes as it delivers teaching to those who do <br>
not have access to the internet and equalises teaching methods and material <br>
across schools within a country or region.  </p>
<br>
 
 
<br>
<li>Availability</li>
<p>  Improve availability of learning technology for students with Special Educational <br>
Needs and /or Disabilities (SEND): digital technologies can provide useful support<br> 
to SEND students, especially if they are part of a coherent and overarching process.  </p>
<br>


<br>
<li>Support Tearches</li>
<p>Support teachers: teachers should learn how to adapt their role to a situation in <br>
which they can communicate only online and in which even students typically <br>
performing well at school may lose motivation when shifting to online learning. It is<br> 
crucial to improve teachersâ€™ digital competences across all ages, as well as to ensure <br>
that they are well trained in the pedagogical approaches best suited for online <br>
learning and blended models. </p>
<br>


<br>
<li>Support Parents</li>
<p> Support parents to help their children: parents are an essential element of the <br>
picture, and more so for younger students who cannot be left alone facing the <br>
challenges of online learning. Parents should be involved in the design of the <br>
strategy and in its implementation as they need to fully understand what is taught  </p>
<br>
</ul>
